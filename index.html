      <p>
        We are a group of people at Sheffield Hallam University looking to share
        knowledge about all things programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers could never get anywhere without each others help. Resources
        like Stack Overflow and massively successful open source projects such
        as the Linux Kernel tell us that. shuprog tries to embody the idea that
        everyone can learn from everyone.
      </p>

    <h4>What?</h4>
    <p>
      We have members do talks on technologies they are passionate about, do
      coding challenges (and some coding golf), and organize hackathons. We also
      like going to the pub for a good chinwag.
    </p>

    <h4>When, where, how?</h4>
    <p>
      We meet on Tuesday evenings at 5pm (as far as semester one is concerned).
      Want to find out where? Email <a href="mailto:shuprog@gmail.com">shuprog@gmail.com</a>
      and someone will get back to you and let you know. The only two
      requirements are be an SHU student and tell us a little about yourself.
