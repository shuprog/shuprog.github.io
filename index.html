      <p>
        We are a group of students at Sheffield Hallam University looking to share
        knowledge about all things programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers could never get anywhere without each others help. Resources
        like Stack Overflow and massively successful open source projects such
        as the Linux Kernel prove that. shuprog tries to embody the idea that
        everyone can learn from everyone.

    <h4>What?</h4>
    <p>
      Most of our sessions are members doing talks on technologies they are passionate
      about but we also do coding challenges (such as coding golf), hackathons and play with the
      universities new tech. We also like going to the pub for a good chinwag.
    </p>

    <h4>When, where, how?</h4>
    <p>
      We currently meet on Tuesday evenings at 5pm.
      Want to find out where? Email <a href="mailto:shuprog@gmail.com">shuprog@gmail.com</a>
      and someone will get back to you and let you know. We only require you to be a
      SHU student and tell us a little about yourself.
